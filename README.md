# Cryptocurrencies

#### The primary objective of this project was to examine a dataset that consists of various alternative cryptocurrencies and pinpoint trends that could potentially help us lead their customers to a smart investment. There are so many different cryptocurrencies out in the market that inespecting all under a microscopic lens is almost impossible. We used unsupervised machine learning to identify clusters  so that we can investigate them as groups. 

### Deliverables

#### There were 4 main steps for this project:
    - Preprocessing the Data for PCA
    - Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
    - Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
    - Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
